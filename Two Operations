A target number is given and it should be reached from 0. You can either 'add 1' or 'multiply 2'.
Find minimum number of ways to reach the target number.

def no_of_steps(target):
	count=0
	while(target>0):
		if target%2==0:
			target=target//2
			count+=1
		else:
			target=target-1
			count+=1
	print(target," : ",count)
	
no_of_steps(7)
no_of_steps(25)
no_of_steps(99)
