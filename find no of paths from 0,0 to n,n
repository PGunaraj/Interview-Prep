#RECURSIVE APPROACH - time comp increases exponentially
#start from 0,0.
#you can go in all 4 dir.
#you should not visit the same node again in a path. So maintain a visited array.

  if i==n and j==n:

#ITERATIVE APPROACH
#have a count array/matrix and update each cell's value
#each cell value = (i-1,j) and (i,j-1) #we can move only right or up. so prev i or j value alone needed.
#m - row, n - col

	count=[[0 for y in range(n)] for x in range(m)]
	
	#making 1st row as 1
	for i in range(m):
		count[i][0]=1
		
	#making 1st column as 1
	for j in range(n):
		count[0][j]=1
	
	#from second row, we start changing each cell's value
	for i in range(1,m):
		for j in range(n):
			count[i][j]=count[i-1][j]+count[i][j-1]
	
	#desired cel is last cell
