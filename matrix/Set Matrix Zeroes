Q.   if an elem in input matrix is 0 then make its entire row and col as 0
Ans. store indexes of all 0's present in matrix in temp array. traverse the temp array and make row and col 0 for each index. 

def setZeroes(self, matrix):
  row=len(matrix)
  if row>0:
    col=len(matrix[0])
    temp=[]
    
    #getting the indexes of 0
    for i in range(row):
        for j in range(col):
            if matrix[i][j]==0:
                temp.append([i,j])
    
    #making row and col of matrix where 0 is present
    for i in range(len(temp)):
    
        #row where 0 is present
        r=temp[i][0]
        
        #col where 0 is present
        c=temp[i][1]
        
        #making row 0
        for k in range(row):
            matrix[k][c]=0
            
        #making col 0
        for k in range(col):
            matrix[r][k]=0



#without using temp array, change the matrix in place
#2O(n) = O(n)


def setZeroes(self, matrix):
    FirstRow = False
    FirstCol = False

    r = len(matrix)
    c = len(matrix[0])

    #checking if first row has any 0
    for i in range(c):
        if matrix[0][i] == 0:
            FirstRow = True
            break

    #checking if first column has any 0
    for i in range(r):
        if matrix[i][0] == 0:
            FirstCol = True
            break

    #setting first row's col to 0 when 0 is found in same row diff col
    #setting first col's row to 0 when 0 is found in same col diff row
    for i in range(1,r):
        for j in range(1,c):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][0] = 0
                matrix[0][j] = 0

    #making entire row and column as 0
    for i in range(1,r):
        for j in range(1,c):
            if matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][j] = 0
        
    #if 1st row contains 0 then make entire 1st row 0
    if FirstRow:
        for i in range(c):
            matrix[0][i] = 0

    #if 1st column contains 0 then make entire 1st column 0
    if FirstCol:
        for i in range(r):
            matrix[i][0] = 0
